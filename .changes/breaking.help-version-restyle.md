- Style the default help page and version line with semantic theme tokens and explicit bold and italic modifiers. Align help columns by terminal width, including wide and combining characters.
- Include the formatter's declared default in its option description. Keep graph facts, defaults, and authored examples literal.

### Migration

**Affected surface.** Exact-byte consumers of the default help and version views, including snapshots and wrappers that call their `render` functions.

**Why.** These views now return marked strings for core to resolve under the destination's rendering policy. Help columns use terminal width instead of JavaScript string length.

**Before and after.** A capable terminal previously printed an unstyled application name. It now prints a bold highlighted name. The formatter description changes from `Select the output format: records, json, jsonl.` to `Select the output format: records, json, jsonl. Default: records.`

**Steps.**

1. For plain output, set `rendering: { color: 'never', modifiers: 'never' }` on the Application or invocation. `NO_COLOR` alone preserves modifiers at a capable terminal.
2. Update help snapshots for the formatter sentence and Unicode column alignment.
3. Pass default view output through `out.render` so core resolves its markers. Keep custom whole-view overrides when the application requires different output.

**Validation.** Run help and version under Node and Bun with both styles disabled, then with `loomTheme()` and styles enabled. Compare stdout, stderr, exit codes, and final newlines against the updated expectations.
