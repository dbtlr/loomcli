- Restore automatic Application global types in independently authored Commands and extracted actions through one shallow `Register.environment` augmentation.
- Remove named Command `globals` configuration. The Application supplies validated global values to every action.
- Add immutable `Command.extend()` and `Application.extend()` calls that remain available after action registration. A later value replaces the complete earlier value from the same descriptor.

### Migration

**Affected surface.** Named Command constructors that receive `globals`, and TypeScript Commands whose actions read Application globals.

**Why.** Application ownership should require one declaration, with global types available throughout its compiler project.

**Before and after.**

Before:

```ts
const read = new Command('read', { globals }).action(handler);
const app = new Application('app', { globals }).command(read);
```

After, in the Application module:

```ts
import type { EnvironmentOf } from '@loomcli/core';

const configured = new Application('app', { globals });
declare module '@loomcli/core' {
  interface Register {
    environment: EnvironmentOf<typeof configured>;
  }
}
const app = configured.command(read);
```

The Command module now uses `new Command('read').action(handler)` without importing globals.

**Steps.**

1. Remove `globals` from named Command constructor options and remove unused globals imports.
2. Keep the runtime globals declaration on the Application. Register its configured value before attaching Commands or registering the root action.
3. Include the registration module in that application's TypeScript project. Use separate projects for applications with different registrations; reusable libraries omit consumer registration.
4. To customize an imported Command, derive `command.extend(extensionValue)` and attach the returned value. Keep a self-typed extracted handler's original initializer ending in `action()`.

**Validation.** Run the application's TypeScript check and invocation tests. Confirm detached actions infer global schema outputs, unknown keys fail, and existing global CLI spellings still reach their actions. See the [SDK reference](docs/core.md#modular-authoring).
