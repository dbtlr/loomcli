# Change fragments

This directory holds the package's pending changelog entries, one fragment per change. \`loom changelog write\` cuts the next version from them into \`CHANGELOG.md\`.

## Name the fragment

- \`breaking.<slug>.md\` is a breaking change, \`feature.<slug>.md\` a feature, and \`<slug>.md\` a fix.
- Choose a unique, nonempty slug, such as \`feature.list-by-tag.md\`. A bare \`feature.md\` or \`breaking.md\` is invalid.
- Keep fragments directly in \`.changes/\`. A subdirectory or a file that is not Markdown is invalid. A hidden entry, one whose name starts with \`.\`, is ignored.
- This \`README.md\` is the guide, not a fragment.

## Write the entry

Write one or more Markdown bullets. Start each with a verb, such as \`Add\`, \`Fix\`, \`Change\`, or \`Remove\`, and state what a consumer can now do or what behavior changed. Keep implementation history out. A fragment has no frontmatter and no headings, except the migration section of a breaking change.

\`\`\`markdown
- Add the \`--tag\` option to \`notes list\`, which lists only the notes with that tag.
\`\`\`

## Explain a breaking change

A change is breaking when a consumer must change their code or requirements to update. After the bullets, add one \`### Migration\` section with these five labels:

\`\`\`\`markdown
- Rename the \`--out\` option to \`--output\`.

### Migration

**Affected surface.** Scripts that pass \`--out\`.

**Why.** Every other command spells it \`--output\`.

**Before and after.**

\`\`\`sh
notes export --out notes.json
notes export --output notes.json
\`\`\`

**Steps.**

1. Replace \`--out\` with \`--output\` in each script.

**Validation.** Run each script and check that it writes its file.
\`\`\`\`

## The next version

The highest kind present decides the next version.

| Current version | Highest kind present | Next version |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| \`0.0.0\`         | Any                  | \`0.1.0\`      |
| \`0.4.7\`         | Breaking             | \`0.5.0\`      |
| \`0.4.7\`         | Feature or fix       | \`0.4.8\`      |
| \`1.4.7\`         | Breaking             | \`2.0.0\`      |
| \`1.4.7\`         | Feature              | \`1.5.0\`      |
| \`1.4.7\`         | Fix                  | \`1.4.8\`      |

A prerelease version, such as \`1.2.0-next.1\`, cannot be cut.

## Check and cut

- \`loom changelog check\` validates every fragment and names each invalid one. It needs no git history, so CI can run it.
- \`loom changelog write\` prepends the release section to \`CHANGELOG.md\`, sets \`version\` in \`package.json\`, and deletes the consumed fragments. It orders entries by the commit that added each fragment, so it needs full git history. \`--date YYYY-MM-DD\` dates the release, \`--narrative FILE\` copies prose above the entries, and \`--dry-run\` prints the section and the next version and writes nothing.
- \`write\` refreshes no lockfile, so run your package manager after a cut.
