# Keep the changelog

This package cuts its version from change fragments in \`${changes}/\`. The fragment guide, \`${changes}/README.md\`, holds the naming rules, the body grammar, and the version table. Read it before writing a fragment.

The \`loom\` bin is installed in the package, so run it through the package manager, such as \`pnpm loom changelog check\` or \`npx loom changelog check\`, and the package's \`check\` script runs \`tsc --noEmit\`, the linter, and the test runner.

## Record a change

1. Decide whether a consumer can see the change: a new or removed option, command, or export, changed output or errors, or a changed runtime requirement. A refactor, a test, or a chore that changes no behavior needs no fragment.
2. Pick the kind. A change that makes a consumer change their code or requirements is breaking, a compatible addition is a feature, and anything else is a fix.
3. Name the fragment \`breaking.<slug>.md\`, \`feature.<slug>.md\`, or \`<slug>.md\` with a unique slug, directly in \`${changes}/\`.
4. Write one Markdown bullet per result, starting with a verb. A breaking fragment adds one \`### Migration\` section with the five labels the guide shows.
5. When a later change alters what an earlier pending fragment says, edit or delete that fragment instead of adding a contradicting one.
6. Run \`loom changelog check\` and fix each fragment it names.

## Cut a version

1. Make sure the clone has full git history, because the cut orders entries by the commit that added each fragment.
2. Run \`loom changelog write --dry-run\` and read the section and the next version it prints.
3. Run \`loom changelog write\`, with \`--date YYYY-MM-DD\` or \`--narrative FILE\` when the release needs them. Add \`--target VERSION\` to cut a chosen version, such as \`--target 0.11.0\`; its release part must meet or exceed the minimum the pending fragments need (a target equal to the computed version is accepted, and \`0.11.0-rc.1\` ranks below \`0.11.0\`), and the cut fails and names the minimum otherwise.
4. Run the package manager's install, because the cut refreshes no lockfile.
5. Commit \`${changelog}\`, \`package.json\`, each file \`sharedVersion\` lists in \`loom.config.json\`, the lockfile, and the deleted fragments together.

## Cut a prerelease

1. Run \`loom changelog write --target VERSION-PRERELEASE\`, such as \`--target 0.11.0-rc.1\`. It sets the version, writes no changelog section, and keeps every fragment pending. A package at a stable version other than \`0.0.0\` needs that version's \`## v<version> - <date>\` section in \`${changelog}\` first.
2. Run \`loom changelog notes VERSION-PRERELEASE\` to print the pending fragments as the candidate's release notes.
3. Cut the next candidate with a higher prerelease, such as \`--target 0.11.0-rc.2\`, or finalize with \`loom changelog write\`, which cuts the release part, \`0.11.0\`, writes its section, and consumes the fragments. When a fragment added since raises the minimum past that release part, the cut fails and asks for \`--target\`.
4. Run the package manager's install after a cut that sets versions, because the cut refreshes no lockfile.
5. Commit the changed manifests and the lockfile, as in a version cut. A prerelease changes no fragment and no changelog.

## Read a version's notes

Run \`loom changelog notes VERSION\`. A cut version prints the body of its section in \`${changelog}\`, and the package's current prerelease prints its pending fragments. Any other version fails.
